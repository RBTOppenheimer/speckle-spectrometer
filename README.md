# spectrometer-cnn
using CNN for spectrum reconstruction using all fiber spectromter

# results
- in single line reconstruction, cnn is able to reconstruct sub correlation images with noiseless image
- in multiple line (5 lines) reconstruction, cnn perform similar to linear reconstruction

# facts
- noise is about 1/10th of the whole mean value.

# goals of next steps
- compare with lsq optimization
- add noise
